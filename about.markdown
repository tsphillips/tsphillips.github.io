I am a computer scientist and polymath, who, like many of my ilk, has numerous interests spanning both the creative and the technical.
By creative, I mean implicated in the creation of novel works, some aesthetic and some not.
By technical, I mean describing or derived from formal systems.
My primary interests are language, computation, representation, and music.

I am a hacker, in almost every sense of the word, and tend to be busy with side projects all of the time.

## Professional

I have been fortunate to have had a very diverse career, spanning decades in both technical and managerial roles.
My education includes doctoral studies in education, graduate studies in public administration, M.S. in computer information systems, B.A. in Psychology, and undergraduate and graduate studies in computer science.
My professional work experience includes:

- Founder/cofounder of four startups
- Over 20 years experience with the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community
- Technical management for multi-million dollar programs for the Department of Defense, including an <a href="https://aida.mitre.org/acat/">ACAT IA</a> program
- Executive producer for over 25 education and entertainment products
- Served in the U.S. Marines as a Russian linguist, and in the U.S. Army National Guard repairing communications equipment
- Decades of experience in computer programming and system/network administration

I currently work as the Chief Technical Officer at <a href="http://www.ridgebacknet.com">Ridgeback Network Defense, Inc.</a>, a cybersecurity company that focuses on deception technology and interactive defense. If you like the idea of autonomous security systems and have a knack for hacking, feel free to contact me at tom@ridgebacknet.com.
